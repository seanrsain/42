			Or maybe you were one of the guys who tried to cram everything in the last minute. Whatever said, we have a solution to all your problems.
			Quite literally in fact. This site is a hub for questions and discussions. If ever you have a question regarding any subject you can type 
			the question on the discussion forum and wait for people to answer them. In case you want professional opinion, 
			you can go to the mentors page and post the question. Or you can clarify your doubts by going through the quizzes.
